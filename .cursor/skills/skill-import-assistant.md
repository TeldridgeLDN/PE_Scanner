## Overview

The Skill Import Assistant helps you:

1. **Scan sibling projects** for reusable code
2. **Map skills to PRD requirements** (coverage analysis)
3. **Generate import plans** with phases
4. **Track adaptation progress**
5. **Validate alignment** post-import

## Import Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Sibling Projects

```bash
# List potential source projects
ls -la ~/  # or appropriate parent directory

# Common locations to check:
# ~/[project-name]/.cursor/skills/
# ~/[project-name]/src/lib/
# ~/[project-name]/packages/shared/
```
