  - Tested RR.L: UK stock auto-correction
- ✅ **All changes committed and pushed to GitHub**

## Files Modified
- `README.md` - Updated status from "Phase 1" to "COMPLETE", added real examples, updated tech stack
- `USAGE.md` - **NEW** Comprehensive 545-line usage guide with examples, signal interpretation, advanced usage
- `src/pe_scanner/portfolios/loader.py` - Minor formatting (from earlier session)

## Tasks Updated
**All 15 PRD tasks marked DONE:**
- Task 1: Setup Project Environment ✅
- Task 2: Yahoo Finance Data Fetcher ✅
- Task 3: Portfolio Loader ✅
- Task 4: P/E Compression Analysis ✅
- Task 5: UK Stock Correction ✅
- Task 6: Stock Split Detection ✅
- Task 7: Data Quality Validation ✅
- Task 8: Fair Value Scenarios ✅
- Task 9: Manual Verification Support ✅
- Task 10: Portfolio Ranking ✅
- Task 11: Markdown Report Generator ✅
- Task 12: CLI (Command-Line Interface) ✅
- Task 13: Momentum_Squared Integration & diet103 Hooks ✅
- Task 14: Comprehensive Test Suite ✅
- Task 15: Performance Optimization ✅

## Decisions Made
- **Documentation structure**: Split between README (quick reference) and USAGE.md (comprehensive guide)
- **Real examples over theoretical**: Used actual live CLI outputs from testing session
- **Signal interpretation table**: Created clear thresholds for compression signals (STRONG_BUY > +30%, etc.)
- **Production status declaration**: Project officially marked as production-ready v0.1.0

## Key Features Documented
- P/E compression analysis with configurable signals
- Automatic UK stock pence/pounds correction
- Stock split detection
- Data quality validation with confidence scoring
- Fair value scenarios (bear 17.5x / bull 37.5x multiples)
- Portfolio ranking and reporting
- Comprehensive CLI with analyze/verify/fetch/status commands
- Momentum_Squared format support
- diet103 validation hooks
- ThreadPoolExecutor concurrent fetching
- In-memory caching with TTL

## Blockers / Open Questions
**None** - Project is production-ready

## Next Session
- **Potential Focus Areas:**
  1. Use StockSignal for actual portfolio analysis (ISA/SIPP)
  2. Backtest against Momentum_Squared historical data
  3. Consider Phase 5+ enhancements (web interface, database storage, ML)
  4. Apply learnings to other investment analysis tools
  5. Document real-world trading results

## Memories Created/Updated
- None created this session (user asked about wrap-up protocol instead)
- **Potential memories for next session:**
  - StockSignal project structure and CLI usage patterns
  - P/E compression methodology and signal interpretation
  - UK stock data correction patterns

## Commits Made
- `9036b28` - docs: Update README and add comprehensive USAGE guide
- `18b3e23` - feat: Complete StockSignal v0.1.0 implementation (previous session)

## Quick Reference for Next Session

**What StockSignal Does:**
Identifies P/E compression opportunities by comparing trailing vs. forward P/E ratios, signaling when analyst expectations suggest undervaluation.

**Key Commands:**
```bash
pe-scanner fetch --ticker AAPL        # Analyze individual stock
pe-scanner analyze --portfolio ISA    # Analyze full portfolio
pe-scanner verify --ticker HOOD       # Manual verification checklist
pe-scanner status                     # System configuration
```

**Real Results:**
- AAPL: +10.11% compression → Consider buying (moderate value signal)
- NVDA: +1.94% compression → Hold (premium priced, growth may be priced in)
- GOOGL: -12.95% compression → Caution (EPS expected to decline)

**Project Status:**
🎉 **PRODUCTION READY** - All PRD requirements met, documented, tested, and published to GitHub.
