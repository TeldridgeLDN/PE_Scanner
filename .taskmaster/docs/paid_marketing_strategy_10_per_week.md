# StockSignal Paid Marketing Strategy
## Budget: £10/week (£40/month)

**Date:** 3 December 2024  
**Target Audience:** UK retail investors (ISA/SIPP holders), day traders, portfolio managers  
**Goal:** Acquire first 100 free users → convert 10% to Pro (£25/mo)

---

## Executive Summary

With £10/week, we can't compete on ad spend. Instead, we'll use **micro-targeted paid amplification** to boost high-performing organic content. This "organic-first, paid-second" approach maximises ROI by only spending on proven winners.

### Strategy: "Viral Headline Amplification"

1. **Create shareable content** (free) → Headlines, social cards
2. **Test organically first** (free) → Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn
3. **Amplify winners only** (£10/week) → Boost posts that get traction
4. **Convert to email** → Portfolio upload gate
5. **Nurture to Pro** → Email sequence

---

## Budget Allocation (£10/week)

| Channel | Weekly Spend | Strategy |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Reddit Promoted Posts** | £5 | Boost winning r/UKInvesting posts |
| **Twitter/X Boost** | £3 | Amplify viral analysis tweets |
| **LinkedIn Sponsored** | £2 | B2B audience (financial advisors) |
| **Reserve/Testing** | £0 | Roll over to next week if unspent |

**Monthly Total: £40**

├── Identify top performer (>50 upvotes)
│
Week 2 (Paid Amplification):
├── Boost top post as "Promoted Post"
├── Target: UK, 25-55, finance interest

Title: I built a free tool that found these 3 overvalued UK stocks 
in my ISA - here's what P/E compression revealed

Body:
I've been using P/E compression analysis on my ISA portfolio and found 
some interesting signals. Here's what it showed:

🔴 HOOD: -113% compression → Market expects 53% earnings collapse
🟢 BATS.L: +62% compression → Undervalued dividend play  
🟢 META: +42% compression → Strong fundamentals, cheap

The tool gives you shareable headlines like:
"🚨 HOOD is priced like it's going bankrupt"

Free to use, no signup required: stocksignal.app

```

**Expected Results (£5/week):**
- 500-1,000 post views
- 50-100 site clicks
- 5-10 email captures
- Cost per click: £0.05-0.10

### 2. Twitter/X (£3/week) - Viral Amplification

**Why Twitter:**
- FinTwit community is highly engaged
- Analysis threads go viral
- Low cost to boost tweets (£1-3 minimum)

**Strategy: "Analysis Thread Boosting"**

Only boost tweets that already have organic traction (>10 likes in 24h).

**Organic Content Calendar:**
```
Monday:    Weekly "Overvalued Stocks" thread (3-5 tickers)
Wednesday: "What Would Have To Be True" anchoring posts
Friday:    "This Week's Biggest P/E Moves" summary
```

**Sample Tweet Thread to Boost:**

```
🧵 I analyzed 50 popular stocks with P/E compression. Here are the
3 most overvalued heading into 2025:

1/ HOOD (Robinhood) -113% compression
Market expects earnings to COLLAPSE by 53%.
Current price: $114 → Fair value: $28

"HOOD would need to 2.5x profits to justify today's price"

### 3. LinkedIn (£2/week) - B2B Angle

**Why LinkedIn:**
- Financial advisors, wealth managers
- Higher lifetime value audience
- Good for "portfolio analysis" messaging

**Strategy: Professional Content Boosting**

Target posts that position StockSignal as a professional tool.

**Sample LinkedIn Content:**

```
🎯 How I screen client portfolios for earnings risk

Traditional screeners show you CURRENT P/E.
But they miss what the market EXPECTS to happen.

P/E Compression Analysis reveals:
→ Which stocks are priced for earnings collapse
→ Which are undervalued relative to growth
→ Clear BUY/SELL/HOLD signals

I built a free tool that does this in 30 seconds.

This week's findings:
• 3 FTSE 100 stocks showing warning signs
• 2 hidden value opportunities in the AIM market
