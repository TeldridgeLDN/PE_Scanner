- "Get clear BUY/SELL signals from market data. **30 seconds**. **3 free per day**."

## Mobile-First Considerations

Headlines must work on **mobile screens** (50% of traffic):

**Too Long (Wraps awkwardly):**
- ❌ "Your Portfolio Might Be Holding a Stock That's Quietly Going Bankrupt"

**Just Right:**
- ✅ "Don't Let Your ISA Hold a Collapsing Stock"
- ✅ "Get Your BUY/SELL Answer in 30 Seconds"
- ✅ "Spot Earnings Collapses Before Your Portfolio Does"

**Launch with:**

```
Headline: "Don't Let Your ISA Hold a Collapsing Stock"
Subheading: "Spot earnings disasters before they destroy your tax-free savings. Free 30-second scan."
CTA: "Check My ISA Now (Free) →"
```

**Rationale:**
1. **UK-specific** (laser-focused on primary market)
